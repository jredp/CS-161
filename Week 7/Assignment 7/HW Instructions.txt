The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data. 
[]1. Write a function named findMode that takes as parameters an array of int and the size of the array, 
	and returns a vector containing the mode(s).  
------ usage: findMode(int array[])
		vector findMode(int [] array, sizeofarray) 
		{
			return vector;
		}
[]3. If there is just a single most frequent value, the vector will only contain that one value, 
	but if multiple values tie for maximum frequency, the vector will need to contain all such values.  
------ find the most of one item, tally
	
[]4. This includes the case where every number in the array appears only once.  

[]5. Each mode should appear only once in the vector. 
------ IE if there are 2 2's, only show 1 2

[]6. The values in the vector that is returned must be in ascending order.
------ begin / end sort
------ std::sort(result.begin(), result.end());

[]7. If you need to sort a vector, it's similar to sorting an array, 
	but specifying the beginning and end of the vector look a little bit different.
------ If your vector is named result, then it'd look like: "std::sort(result.begin(), result.end());"

The most straightforward approach is to:
[]Iterate (loop) through the array to find out what the highest frequency for any value is without storing any of the values.
[]Iterate through the array again, this time comparing the counts for each value to the highest frequency that you already found,
[]if the count for a value is the same as the highest frequency, push that value into your results vector.

The file must be named: findMode.cpp
